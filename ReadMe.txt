Sometimes it can be hard to find an empty seat on high-speed trains. The program is locking a seat from the selected 
train autonomously. If there is not any available seat, this program refreshes the ticket page every 20 seconds and 
searches for an empty seat. When it finds an available seat, it locks the seat by selecting it.
